# Grand Theft Auto - IP grabber
This is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the ability to single out IP addresses from an online GTA 5 lobby on a console.

## How does it work?
In order to use this tool, you'll need to meet the following requirements:

1.  Your console and Linux machine must be connected in some way, such as through a VPN.
2.  You must have a console running Grand Theft Auto 5 and a stable network connection.
3.  The Linux machine must have the `tcpdump` utility and a Debian operating system.

To use the tool, clone the GitHub repository and run the `Main.py` file on your Linux machine, using the command `sudo main.py CONSOLES_LOCAL_IP_HERE`. The IP addresses of other players in your GTA 5 lobby will be displayed in the terminal.
